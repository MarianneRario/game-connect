# game-connect
An implementation of Game Connect 4 that will be use for gamification for the purpose of cognitive stimulation of older adults with Mild Cognitive Impairment (thesis)

The goal of Game Connect 4 is to be the first player to get three in a row on a 3-by-3 grid.
It has two players the red and the yellow.
In this game, the player who is playing “Yellow” will always goes first and will be followed by “Red”. Players alternate placing yellow circles and red circles on the board until either player has three in a row, horizontally, vertically, or diagonally or until all squares on the grid are filled. If a player is able to draw three circles with the same colors on a row, then that player wins. If all squares are filled and neither player has made a complete row of red and yellow circles, then the game is a draw.
